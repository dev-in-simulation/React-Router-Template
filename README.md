# React Router Template

Used to expedite setting a new project up using React Router and Sass. Removing some of the setup code from create-react-app.

## Clone the repo

Clone repo with default project name (same as repo)

```
git clone https://github.com/niems/React-Router-Template.git
```

Clone repot with a new project name (ex. testProject)

```
git clone https://github.com/niems/React-Router-Template.git testProject
```

## Install modules

After cloning, cd into the directory.

```
cd testProject
```

Then install the modules.

```
npm install
```

## Modifying Sass

The Sass will need to be recompiled if modified. I use Dart Sass's standalone cli, found [here](https://sass-lang.com/install)

## Features

- custom flask logo: svg/png/ico
- create-react-app bloat removed
- sass minimal setup
- react router basic setup
