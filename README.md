# React Router Template

git clone to use create-react-app with React Router, without the boilerplate.

To clone, run "git clone https://github.com/niems/React-Router-Template.git".
This will create a new directory with the same name as the repo.

## Clone the repo:

Default project name (same as repo): run "git clone https://github.com/niems/React-Router-Template.git"

New project name (ex. testProject): run git clone https://github.com/niems/React-Router-Template.git testProject"

## Install modules

After cloning, cd into the directory.

```
cd testProject
```

Then install the modules.

```
npm install
```

## Modifying Sass

The Sass will need to be recompiled if modified. I use Dart Sass's standalone cli, found [here](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass)

## Features

- custom flask logo: svg/png/ico
- create-react-app bloat removed
- sass minimal setup
- react router basic setup
